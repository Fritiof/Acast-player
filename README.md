# Acast super player

Fun assignment!

I decided to wrap the application in a React.Context to make it easier to pass data around the application. I thought of it as a good foundation if I would have continued building on this player.

There are some things that I wish I had more time to fix, like how the markers are presented. The UX of the markers presentation is something I would have loved to explore more.

Another thing that I would have liked to spend more time on in error handling, and over all app integrations with the player part of the app. If I press play on an episode in the list of episodes, it would be nice to show that one as playing. Easy fix, but I respect the timebox for this assignment.

I left out the optional part of the markers assignment, because of time reasons. Sorray!

Happy reading and have a merry christmas and a happy new year!!
